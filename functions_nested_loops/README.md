## Functions & nested loops

This section introduced us to header files, and required us to solve a variety of problems involving functions and nested loops.

Problems 0 to 11 were to be solved without using the standard library.

To pass these problems our code was passed through the "Betty" linter, which ensured our code was formatted nicely and had adequate comments.
